                Easy Learning with HTML "Try it Yourself".
                HTML stands for Hyper Text Markup Language
                HTML is the standard markup language for creating Web pages
                HTML describes the structure of a Web page
                HTML consists of a series of elements
                HTML elements tell the browser how to display the content
                HTML elements label pieces of content such as "this is a heading", "this is a paragraph", "this is a link", etc.

            Web pages can be created and modified by using professional HTML editors.
            However, for learning HTML we recommend a simple text editor like Notepad (PC) or TextEdit (Mac).
            We believe that using a simple text editor is a good way to learn HTML.
